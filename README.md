YesDice
=======

YesDice is an online dice throwing web-app. It's meant for rpg and strategy games, like the D&D dungeon crawler or the Infinity tabletop skirmish battle game.


Current status
--------------
The current status is early alpha. The barebone structure for the app. A message is printed the browser console, confirming successful app initiation.

Roadmap
-------
1. Be able to cast / roll a dice object, d6, and get a random result
2. Roll multiple d6
3. Add several standard dice: d3, d4, d8, d10, d12, d20
4. Add option to create your own dice.
5. Add option to save dice / dice throwing session
6. Create an interface that rivals the feel and ease of classic dice throwing as much as possible.

Technical goals
---------------
- Use as much native JavaScript as possible. Keep it lean. Older browser are not supported.
- Keep everything on the client-side. This rule may be broken when the app gets to a very advanced stage.
- Use library's sparingly.


Background
----------
I'm a programmer by day and tabletop gamer by night. I want to combine the two. Also, the lack of a really nice online dice roller for strategy games suprised me. Personal learning goals are writing well structured OO JavaScript and perhaps using a front-end JS framework.
